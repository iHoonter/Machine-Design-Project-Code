# Goal of this Code

Create a package of code capable of designing a shaft based on a set of given requirements.

# Design Requirements for Assignment

## Gear Analysis
- Input power of 9.5 HP
- Input speed of 3000 rpm
- Output speed of 400 $\pm$ 1% rpm
- Helical gears with helix angle $\psi = 30\degree$ and a normal pressure angle $\phi_n = 20\degree$
- Pinion and gear to operate for 1000 hours at 90% reliability
- Commercial enclosed unit
- Uncrowned teeth
- Not adjusted at assembly or lapped
- Use $K_s = 1$ and $C_f = 1$
- Light shock load from engine and moderate shock load from wheels
- Safety factors against bending and wear are to be $S_F = S_H = 1.2$

## Shaft Analysis
- Design for infinite life
- Material is AISI 1010 CD with $S_{ut} = 53$ ksi and $S_y = 44$ ksi
